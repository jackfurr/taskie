# taskie
My personal task organizer based on the MonkeyGTD which is based on TiddlyWiki.

One of my favorite features of MonkeyGTD was the ability to create an action (task)
that can be dependant upon another action.  When the parent action (task) was complete,
MonkeyGTD would find all of the sub-actions (sub-tasks) that are dependant upon the
parent action and marking them as 'Next'.
